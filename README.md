Radar ERP Calculator

A Windows-based application built with WPF (.NET) to calculate the Effective Radiated Power (ERP) and Antenna Gain for radar systems. It also calculates Jammer required power for a particular Radar at user defined distance. It also claculates Radar range based on target RCS. 
This tool helps users input radar parameters and visualize the results in an intuitive interface.

## ‚ú® Features
 - Modern UI with customizable styles and themes.

 - Real-time calculation of Antenna Gain and ERP.

 - Calculates Jammer required Power to Jam a particular Radar at defined Distance.

 - Calculates Jammer Range based on target RCS.

 - Data grid to store and review multiple radar parameter sets.

 - Input validation for numerical fields.
